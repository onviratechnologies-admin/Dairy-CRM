    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: December 25, 2025</em></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      At Onvira Technologies, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information.
      This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and the safeguards we apply to keep it secure.
      We comply with applicable privacy laws and will continue to update our practices as industry standards evolve.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Personal information you provide (e.g., name, email via Apple Login).</li>
      <li>Consent preferences stored securely using Apple Keychain and UserDefaults.</li>
      <li>Usage data such as pages visited, time spent, and interactions with features.</li>
      <li>Cookies and similar tracking technologies for improving user experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Register and authenticate you as a user.</li>
      <li>Provide a seamless and personalized experience.</li>
      <li>Enable features through secure processing and validation.</li>
      <li>Support collaboration features where data may be shared in controlled ways with other users.</li>
      <li>Improve our services and maintain security.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage & Protection</h2>
    <p>
      All user data is stored securely using Apple’s ecosystem (CloudKit, Keychain, UserDefaults).
      Sensitive information is protected with industry‑leading security standards.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      We retain your data only as long as your account is active or as required to provide services.
      If you delete your account, all of your personal information will be permanently deleted.
      However, data that has been shared publicly or used for collaborative features will not be treated as personal data,
      as deleting it may affect the functionality of the application or other users’ experience.
      If you have concerns about such shared or customer data, you may contact us at
      <a href="mailto:contact@onviratechnologies.com">contact@onviratechnologies.com</a>.
      We will review your request and, if valid and in compliance with applicable laws, take appropriate action.
      Please note that customer data belongs to the customer, and only they have the right to request its deletion.
    </p>

    <h2>User Rights</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on your location, you may have rights under applicable laws (such as GDPR or CCPA), including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The right to access the personal data we hold about you.</li>
      <li>The right to request correction or deletion of your personal data.</li>
      <li>The right to withdraw consent at any time.</li>
      <li>The right to lodge a complaint with a data protection authority.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Consent & Control</h2>
    <p>
      You may accept or decline this Privacy Policy. Declining may limit access to certain features.
      You may withdraw consent at any time, and any future changes requiring new data access will be subject to your explicit consent.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Our application is intended for users 13 years and older. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
      If we learn that we have inadvertently collected such data, we will delete it immediately.
    </p>

    <h2>International Users</h2>
    <p>
      If our application becomes available in other countries, we will comply with applicable international privacy laws
      (such as GDPR in the European Union). Local regulations may provide additional rights, which we will honor.
    </p>

    <h2>Third‑Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      Currently, we do not use third‑party services. We rely exclusively on Apple’s ecosystem and APIs.
      If we introduce third‑party integrations in the future, we will update this Privacy Policy and obtain your consent before collecting or sharing data.
    </p>

    <h2>Policy Updates</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect new features or legal requirements.
      When changes occur, we will notify you either in‑app or via email before they take effect.
      Continued use of the app after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
    </p>
